# User Feature Configuration

You can change the Leg features available to you using this command:

{% hint style="info" %}
Command: "leg userconfig"

Alias: "userfeatureset"
{% endhint %}

![Default feature settings](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png>)

As an example, if you want to disable Date Solver for only yourself, do "leg userconfig date\_solver false"

This allows you to customize your Leg experience for yourself, while not affecting anyone else.

To see a list of all features and what they mean, head here:

{% content-ref url="list-of-user-configurable-features/" %}
[list-of-user-configurable-features](list-of-user-configurable-features/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
