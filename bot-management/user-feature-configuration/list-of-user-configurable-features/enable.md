# enable

This controls whether you are able to use Leg.

If you disable this, all Leg commands (except "leg userconfig") will not be usable for you at all.

This is useful for if you want Leg to stop collecting any and all information about you, whether it's because you don't trust it, or because you simply just don't like it :(
