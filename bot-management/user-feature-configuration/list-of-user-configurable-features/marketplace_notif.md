description: Notification when wishlisted card is on Marketplace
---

# marketplace\_notif

This setting determines if you will get DMed by Leg when a card on any of your [Personal Wishlists](../../../karuta-utilities/character-tools/personal-wishlist.md) is added to the [Leg Marketplace](../../../karuta-services/leg-marketplace.md).

The default for this option is Off, as it could be spammy at times.
