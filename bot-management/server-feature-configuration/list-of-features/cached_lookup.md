description: Cached Lookup when Karuta is on cooldown

# cached\_lookup

When you do too many lookups in Karuta, it locks you into a 9 second cooldown and you're forced to wait before doing the lookup again.

This setting changes whether Leg will show cached lookup when this happens, to save you time.
