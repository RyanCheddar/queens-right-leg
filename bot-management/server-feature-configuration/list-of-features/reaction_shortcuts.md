# reaction\_shortcuts

This controls whether Leg will add reaction shortcuts to Karuta menus that have available Leg utilities.

Reaction Shortcuts can be clicked on, which immediately jumps you to the Leg utility without needing you to type in any commands.

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't have Premium in your server? You can get reaction shortcut functionality by enabling "Allow self-added reaction shortcuts".

\
Keep in mind that enabling this may cause issues if your server has other bots with reaction features (e.g. Keqing), and you should probably [channeloverride](../channel-feature-override.md) this feature to off if you have announcement channels where users can add reactions.
