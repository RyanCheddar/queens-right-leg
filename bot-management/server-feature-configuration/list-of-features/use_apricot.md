This setting controls whether your server uses the new Apricot Drop Analysis Engine when analysing drops.

The Apricot Drop Analysis Engine gives more accurate results than the normal engine, but is currently still under heavy development.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Enabling Apricot Engine disables print number detection. Apricot Engine will support print number detection in the future.
{% endhint %}
