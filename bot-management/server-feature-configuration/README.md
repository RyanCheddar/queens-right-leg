# Server Feature Configuration

You can change the Leg features available in your server using this command:

{% hint style="info" %}
Command: "leg featureset"

Aliases: "serverconfig", "serverfeatureset", "guildconfig", "guildfeatureset"
{% endhint %}

![Default feature settings](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png>)

As an example, if you want to disable Date Solver in your entire server, do "leg featureset date\_solver false"

If you want to change the feature configuration for a specific channel only, head here:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="channel-feature-override.md" %}
[channel-feature-override.md](channel-feature-override.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

To see a list of all features and what they mean, head here:

{% content-ref url="list-of-features/" %}
[list-of-features](list-of-features/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
