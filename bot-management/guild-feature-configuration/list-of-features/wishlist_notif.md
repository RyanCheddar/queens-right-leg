# wishlist\_notif

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png>)

This controls the wishlist update messages Leg sends when it's database is updated by actions like Character Lookups, opening your Card Collection and etc.

Some server owners find it neat, some find it annoying. You get to pick whichever one you like!

{% hint style="warning" %}
Disabling this does not mean Leg will stop updating it's database with data from your server.\
The only way to stop that is to not use Leg in your server, or remove the Read Messages permission from it.
{% endhint %}
