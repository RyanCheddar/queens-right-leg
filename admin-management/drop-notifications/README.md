# Drop Notifications

Drop Notifications allow you to set a role to get pinged when a drop (Server or User) fits certain criteria.

Currently, there are three supported criterias:

* Wishlist over x [\[Wishlist Notifications\]](wishlist-count-notifications.md)
* Server Drops [\[Server Drop Notifications\]](server-drop-notifications.md)
* Drop contains special event item [\[Special Drop Notifications\]](special-drop-notifications.md)
