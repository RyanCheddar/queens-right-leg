# Special Drop Notifications

Special Drop Notifications allow you to ping a role when a drop contains a special event item (e.g. Festivus Bow, Egg, Flower etc.)

{% hint style="info" %}
Command: "leg specialnotifications" / "leg specialnotif"

Aliases: "specialdropnotifications", "specialdropnotif", "eventdropnotifications", "eventdropnotif"
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Special Drop Notifications works best when your Karuta drop mode is set to buttons.

If you are using reactions and Karuta isn't adding the reactions fast enough (which might happen if too many drops are happening), notifications might become delayed or even not send entirely.
{% endhint %}
