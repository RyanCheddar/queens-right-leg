# Reminders

Reminders allow you to be notified when something happens. Maybe a character you like just dropped, your date is off cooldown, or maybe a friend is going to come online and etc.

Leg Reminders are integrated into several utilities, allowing you to set reminders with just a click.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Leg Reminders’ notifications are sent using the main Leg bot. If your server is using the temporary bot (Queen’s Right Leg 2), you might need to join Leg’s support server for reminders to function.
