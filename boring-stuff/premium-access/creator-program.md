# Creator Program

{% hint style="warning" %}
Karuta purchases are currently not eligible for the Creator Program, but they will be soon!
{% endhint %}

Are you a Karuta Discord owner or someone who makes content on Youtube (or other platforms)?

If yes, you might be interested in joining Leg's Creator Program! By joining the program, you get a (customizable) creator code that you can share with your members/audience, which you can use to offer discounts back to them or earn a cut from their purchases!

### How it works

Once you join the program, you will receive a creator code that you can share around to anyone who might want to purchase Leg's Premium Access.

If someone purchases Premium Access using your code, you receive a 2% cut from their purchase, and they also receive a 5% discount from your code.

If more than 5 unique users have used your code previously, your cut increases to 5%.

### Eligibility

In order to be able to join the program, you must have one of the following:

* At least 500 members in your Discord server
* At least 500 Youtube subscribers

if you don't meet any of those but you believe that you have a similar audience size on a different platform, try apply anyway!

### Program Guidelines

* You/Your content must not involve/engage in any kind of discriminatory, harmful or illegal behavior.
* Do not use your creator code for your own Leg purchases. We won't stop you, but know that it is potentially illegal and may get you banned from Tebex.

To apply for the Creator Program, send a DM to ModMail in Leg Community (Our Support Server), along with:

* Proof that you meet our eligibility requirements.
* What you want your creator code to be.
* How you want to use the revenue you earn.
