# Server Premium

Server Premium is Premium Access for entire servers. The perks of Server Premium are:

### Bot Perks

* [Personal Premium](personal-premium.md) for all server members\
  (As long as they're using Leg in your server)\
  \* Exceptions apply
* \+5 Ephemeral Reminder Slots for server members\
  (Ephemeral Reminder Slots can only be used in Date Solver, but they bypass the normal per-user Reminder slot limit, even if a user doesn't have Personal Premium.)

* Higher drop quota before [Massdrop Mode](broken-reference) automatically enables (14 drops/3 minutes/channel > 30 drops)

## ⭐️ Server Premium Offers and Discounts ⭐️

### 🎉 Small Server Premium discount (<500 Members)

For servers with less than 500 members, you can get Server Premium with a 50% discount! This applies regardless of what currency you use!

This offer only applies when your server has less than 3 days of Premium Access (or no Premium at all). If you are purchasing Premium with Karuta currency, you must specify that you wish to use the discount + provide proof that your server is eligible (e.g. using a server invite).

### 🎁 Complementary Personal Premium for Server Owners (>500 Members)

For owners of servers with Server Premium that are **NOT** eligible for the Small Server Premium discount, you can now receive complementary Personal Premium access instead! That's 50% of your subscription's value given to you for free!

Personal Premium allows you to access additional perks not provided with Server Premium (seen below), and also allows you to access Premium features anywhere! For clan shoguns, Personal Premium allows you to purchase the Shogun Pass, which provides a myriad of useful and powerful clan features!

To claim this offer, simply run "leg premium" and head to the Server Premium page.
