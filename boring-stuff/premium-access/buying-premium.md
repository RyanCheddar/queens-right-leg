# Buying Premium

There are two ways to buy Premium.

[Buying with USD](https://ryan-46.gitbook.io/queens-right-leg/boring-stuff/premium-access/buying-premium#buying-with-usd) and [Buying with Karuta currencies](buying-premium.md#buying-with-tickets)

Hey! As a heads up, there is now a 7-day Personal Premium trial available in the Tebex store. Try before you buy!
{% endhint %}

## Buying with USD

Buying with USD directly supports the development of Leg.&#x20;

To purchase with USD, head here:

{% hint style="info" %}
Buying Server Premium is only possible if you are the server owner. If you are not the server owner, you will need to buy using tickets instead.
{% endhint %}

Once you have purchased the right package, wait for a DM from Leg.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you have your DMs enabled. If you don't, Leg won't notify you when your purchase goes through.
{% endhint %}

Once you have received a DM from Leg, do "leg premium" and press "Premium Management"

{% hint style="danger" %}
TAKE EXTRA CAUTION AT THIS STEP. Don't accidentally redeem the wrong package.
{% endhint %}

If you are buying for a server, press "Manage Server Premium access". If you aren't, stay where you are.

Make sure the page you're on is showing the Premium status of yourself/the server you're redeeming Premium to.

When you've made sure you are on the right page, press the Redeem button.

{% hint style="success" %}
Congratulations! You / Your server now has Premium access!

You can do "leg premium" to see the duration of your premium, or do "leg premiumtest" to check if Premium access is working.
{% endhint %}

## Buying with Karuta Currencies

Buying with Karuta Currencies is also another way you can support the development for Leg, with no real-world cost!
