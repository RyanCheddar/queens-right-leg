# Shogun Pass

{% hint style="info" %}
The Shogun Pass is no longer a planned feature. Perks of the Shogun Pass will be provided for free to users with Personal Premium.
{% endhint %}

The Shogun Pass is an additional add-on you can purchase that will give you access to a bunch of cool clan-focused features!

{% hint style="warning" %}
To use the Shogun Pass, you must also have Personal Premium. The Shogun Pass is an add-on for Personal Premium and cannot be used standalone.

\
If you do not have Personal Premium, but you do have a server with Server Premium, you might be able to claim free Personal Premium through "leg premium"!
