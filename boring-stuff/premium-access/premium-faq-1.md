### What can I use to buy the Shogun Pass?

You can either use USD or Karuta currencies.

Payment using USD supports a wide variety of payment methods, mainly:

* Credit Card
* Paypal
* Some region-specific platforms (Like Alipay)

Payment using Karuta currencies like tickets is also allowed, conversion rates depend on what the current gem prices are.

At this moment, you cannot purchase the Shogun Pass for anyone other than yourself.

### Can I give my entire server access to the Shogun Pass, like with Premium Access?

At this time, the Shogun Pass is intended to be used by one person only. If this changes in the future, an announcement will be made in Leg Community.

### Can I use Leg without the Shogun Pass?

Yes. Even if you do not have the Shogun Pass, you can still access many clan-related features, and you might still get additional perks with Premium Access.

The Shogun Pass only exists in order to provide the most dedicated Karuta clan shoguns extra powerful tools in their arsenals -- tools that may otherwise be too powerful to provide to users on a large scale.

### Can I purchase the Shogun Pass with tokens?

At this moment, the Shogun Pass does not utilize the token system.

If you purchase the Shogun Pass on Tebex, you are instantly granted the Shogun Pass, and the Shogun Pass will also instantly activate as well.

### Can I get a refund?

Before purchasing the Shogun Pass, you should first familiarize yourself with what it actually does first. For most users, Premium Access is already very enough for their needs.

If you are buying through Tebex, refer to the [Terms of Service](../leg-terms-of-service.md).

If you are buying using Karuta currencies, you can request for a refund within 24 hours after purchase. These requests should be sent through the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/SRWDAk7VnN).

Note that if you do receive a refund, it will likely only be a one-time courtesy. Refunds can be refused for any reason after purchase.

### How can I use USD to buy the Shogun Pass for someone else?

Unfortunately, this is not possible to do at the moment.
