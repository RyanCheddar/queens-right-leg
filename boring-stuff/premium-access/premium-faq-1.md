### What can I use to buy the Shogun Pass?

You can either use USD or Karuta currencies.

Payment using USD supports a wide variety of payment methods, mainly:

* Credit Card
* Paypal
* Some region-specific platforms (Like Alipay)

Payment using Karuta currencies like tickets is also allowed, conversion rates depend on what the current gem prices are.

At this moment, you cannot purchase the Shogun Pass for anyone other than yourself.

### Can I use Leg without the Shogun Pass?

Yes. Even if you do not have the Shogun Pass, you can still access many clan-related features, and you might even get additional perks with only Premium Access as well.

The Shogun Pass only exists in order to provide the most dedicated Karuta clan shoguns extra powerful tools in their arsenals -- tools that may otherwise be too powerful to provide to users on a large scale.

### Can I purchase the Shogun Pass with tokens?A

At this moment, the Shogun Pass does not utilize the token system.

If you purchase the Shogun Pass on Tebex, you are instantly granted the Shogun Pass, and the Shogun Pass will also instantly activate as well.

### Can I get a refund?

Before purchasing the Shogun Pass, you should first familiarize yourself with what it actually does first. For most users, Premium Access is already very enough for their needs.

If you are buying through Tebex, refer to the [Terms of Service](../leg-terms-of-service.md).

If you are buying using Karuta currencies, you can request for a refund within 24 hours after purchase. These requests should be sent through the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/SRWDAk7VnN).

Note that if you do receive a refund, it will likely only be a one-time courtesy. Refunds can be refused for any reason after purchase.

### How can I use USD to buy Server Premium, even if I'm not the server owner?

The easiest way is to just have the owner transfer server ownership to yourself, then you can transfer it back once you have redeemed the premium.

If that isn't possible for any (probably valid) reasons, ask the server owner of your server to DM @RyanC#5785 with the following message:

> I authorize \[Your Name] to purchase Premium access in the bot Queen's Right Leg using USD for my server (\[Server Name] - \[Server ID]), and I acknowledge that in the event of a chargeback or a payment dispute, I accept any repercussions or consequences indicted on me or my server, including but not limited to a permanent blacklist from the bot Queen's Right Leg.

This only needs to be done once. After this is done, you can purchase however many days you need on Tebex, then DM @RyanC#5785 to redeem your tokens into time for your server.

{% hint style="danger" %}
In the event that the purchaser issues a chargeback or any issues occur with their payment, by authorizing the purchaser with this statement, the server owner accepts that any of the following may occur, listed in no particular order:

* Permanent blacklist from Leg for the server
* Permanent blacklist from Leg for the server owner
* Premium access ban for the server

\
Additionally, negative consequences may also occur for the purchaser, as stipulated in the [Terms of Service](../leg-terms-of-service.md).
{% endhint %}
