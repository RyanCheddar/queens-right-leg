### What can I use to buy Premium Access?

You can either use USD or Karuta currencies.

Payment using USD supports a wide variety of payment methods, mainly:

* Credit Card
* Paypal
* Some region-specific platforms (Like Alipay)

Payment using Karuta currencies like tickets is also allowed, conversion rates depend on what the current gem prices are.

### Can I use Leg without Premium Access?

Absolutely! Most features are designed to not require Premium Access. Premium Access isn't meant to be a paywall, but rather a way to support the bot's development while giving rewards in return.

### What are tokens?

Tokens represent the money you used to buy Premium Access on Tebex. A month of Personal Premium is 2 tokens, A month of Server Premium is 4 tokens, and everything scales up accordingly.

This does also allow for, while not recommended, buying 2 months of Personal Premium but redeeming them as 1 month of Server Premium.

This system makes it so you don't need to mess with IDs on Tebex when checking out, allows Tebex functions as chargeback protection to work and allows you to change the type of Premium Access you're redeeming last second.

### Can I get a refund?

If you are buying through Tebex, refer to the [Terms of Service](../leg-terms-of-service.md).

If you are buying using Karuta currencies, you can request for a refund within 24 hours after purchase. These requests should be sent through the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/SRWDAk7VnN).

Note that if you do receive a refund, it will likely only be a one-time courtesy. Refunds can be refused for any reason after purchase.
