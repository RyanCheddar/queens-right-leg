# Premium Access

Running bot hosting isn't free (or easy). That's why Leg provides additional perks to users who pay a ticket fee (or IRL money if you're more into that)

Premium Access isn't required for most of the features in Leg. However, Premium Access gives you the best bot experience possible.

No matter which type of Premium you buy, you'd still be supporting the continued development of Leg tremendously.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please do not buy Premium access for features that might come in the future. Buy it for the features that are currently available.
{% endhint %}
