# Required Permissions

{% hint style="danger" %}
Don't just give Leg Administrator in your server and call it a day. This is a horrible HORRIBLE thing to do, even for verified bots.\
\
Bots can always be compromised at any time, and while this most likely won't happen to Leg, are you sure you want to risk that?
{% endhint %}
