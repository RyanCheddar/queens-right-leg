   (For real, get your own)
5. Directly monetizing access to Leg is not allowed.\

6. Monetizing the Shogun Pass is not allowed.\

   \
   Sharing information or calculations provided by the Shogun Pass is allowed, however.)

#### Premium Access & Shogun Pass ToS

1. If purchasing through Tebex, refunds will only be honored if:\
   &#x20;   **Premium Access**\
   &#x20;         \- Premium access has not been redeemed, or\
   &#x20;         \- If you did not receive any tokens in your account.\
   \
   &#x20;   **Shogun Pass**\
   &#x20;         \- You have not had the Shogun Pass for more than 1 day, or\
   &#x20;         \- You did not receive the Shogun Pass.
2. Chargebacks will be handled and disputed by Tebex, and may lead to you being blacklisted from using Leg.
3. Premium access & the Shogun Pass are absolutely non-transferrable between servers/users.
4. Price adjustments might happen without prior notice, and a refund may not be given to preexisting Premium users or Shogun Pass users.
5. In the case of a price adjustment, if you purchased premium access with real money and used Tebex's auto-renewal feature, you may be eligible for grandfathered pricing if the new price is higher than the old price. Grandfathered pricing is not available for the Shogun Pass.
