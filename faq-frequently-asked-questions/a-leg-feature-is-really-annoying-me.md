# A Leg feature is really annoying me!

If a feature in Leg is annoying you a lot, there is a high likelihood that you can disable that feature.

## Server-wide Configuration

If you are the server's moderator/admin/owner, you can toggle features using the "leg featureset" command.

{% content-ref url="../bot-management/guild-feature-configuration/" %}
[guild-feature-configuration](../bot-management/guild-feature-configuration/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## User-only Configuration

You can also toggle features for yourself only using the "leg userconfig" command.

{% content-ref url="../bot-management/user-feature-configuration/" %}
[user-feature-configuration](../bot-management/user-feature-configuration/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
