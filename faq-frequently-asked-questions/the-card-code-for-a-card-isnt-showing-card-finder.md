# The card code for a card isn't showing!

For some cards, the card code may be unavailable for different reasons.

### ðŸ”¥ "BURNT" - Card likely doesn't/no longer exists

For cards marked as "BURNT", it was either not grabbed when it was dropped, or it was burnt.

Leg uses multiple criterias to determine whether a card was burnt, and these criterias are generally pretty accurate. However, Leg could still occasionally make errors and mark a card as \[BURNT] even though it still exists. For these cards, they'll be unmarked permanently if Leg sees them in circulation, and will remain so unless the card was actually burnt.

### ðŸ«¥ "HIDDEN" - Card was hidden by the card owner

For cards marked as "HIDDEN", the card was hidden by the card owner using the "leg hidecard" command.

This can be for a myriad of reasons, and while you can try to look for the card code yourself, it's not advised as the card owner likely had their own reasoning for wanting the card hidden.

### ðŸ”’ "LOCKED" - Card was dropped too recently

For cards marked as "LOCKED", the card dropped too recently and is temporarily unavailable to avoid low-print sniping.

The restriction applies to cards dropped less than 30 minutes ago. For users with Personal Premium, the restriction is 10 instead.

If you believe the card has already existed for a while, you can try running "kci" on a card with the same edition and a higher print number, which may help with unlocking the card.
