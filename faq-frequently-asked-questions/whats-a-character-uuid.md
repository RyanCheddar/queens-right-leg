# What's a Character UUID?

With the thousands of characters in Karuta, Leg needs a way to quickly distinguish them with minimal hassle.

To do this, Leg gives all characters a UUID that allows Leg to distinguish characters, while also enabling users to use character-based commands without weird replying shenanigans or annoying lookups.

{% hint style="info" %}
Certain characters have a custom UUID for testing purposes. Examples include:

Tears of Themis 路 **Luke Pearce** \[luke]

Genshin Impact 路 **Childe** \[taru]

Sakura Wars TV 路 **Sakura Shinguji** \[sakura]



Leg's own mascot also has a custom UUID.

Queen's Right Leg 路 **Leg** \[leg]\
\
If you see these UUIDs appear in command examples, do not mistake them for just simply character name searches.
{% endhint %}

To find a character's UUID, look them up using "leg lu \[Character Name] / \[Character Series]"&#x20;
