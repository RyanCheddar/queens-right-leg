# Leg isn't analysing my drops!

If Leg isn't replying to your drops, check the following steps to troubleshoot.

* Check if Massdrop Mode is on. You can ask an admin to do "leg massdrop" and see if it's on. Massdrop Mode makes Leg not reply to drops unless a card has a high wishlist count.
* Check if you have Drop Analysis enabled for yourself. To do so, do "leg userconfig" and check if Drop Analysis is on.
* Check if the server has Drop Analysis enabled. To do so, ask an admin to do "leg featureset" and see if Drop Analysis is on.
* Check if Leg is online. You can do so by just click on Leg's name to open his profile.&#x20;
