# Leg isn't responding to me at all!

Is Leg being fussy for no reason? If so, try the following troubleshooting steps:

* Check if Leg is currently online. If not, join the Support Server and ping @RyanC#5785
* Check if you're using the right prefix. Some servers use a custom prefix instead of "leg ", which you can check by doing "\[@Leg] [prefix](../admin-management/prefix-stuff/)". Replace "\[@Leg]" with a ping to Leg.
* Check if your configuration is set properly. To check this, do "[leg userconfig](../bot-management/user-feature-configuration/)" or equivalent. If the command fails, keep reading. If the command works and the settings are all white/red, press "Enable All".
* Check if the server you're in has locked Leg access to certain channels.&#x20;
* Check if Leg has the necessary permissions needed for it to operate.\
  (Send Messages, Read Messages, Embed Links, Use External Emojis)
* Check if the server has configured Leg properly. To do so, ask an admin to do "[leg featureset](../bot-management/server-feature-configuration/)" and see if the settings are all white/red. If they are, press "Enable All" or set the settings back.

If Leg still doesn't work, join the Support Server and @RyanC#5785
