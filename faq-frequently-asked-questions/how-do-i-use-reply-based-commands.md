# How do I use Reply-based Commands?

Reply-based commands are commands that require you to reply to a message from Karuta.

An example would be Collection Viewer, which requires you to reply to a Card Collection message.

![On Desktop, just press the three dots on the right and press Reply.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (37) (1).png>)

![On mobile, hold on the message and press Reply.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>)

Then, just type out your command and send!

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png>)
