# Date Solver

{% hint style="info" %}
Date Solver is still in Beta. You can disable/enable it with:\
\- "[leg userconfig](../bot-management/user-feature-configuration/) date\_solver true/false" (Users)\
\- "[leg featureset](../bot-management/guild-feature-configuration/) date\_solver true/false" (Servers)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, Beta limitations include:

* ~~Incorrect graphics~~
* Missing artwork
* Slow pathfinding
* ~~Unoptimal routing~~ (Routes are pretty decent now)

These issues will hopefully be fixed in the future.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
~~It's highly recommended to disable Leg's Date Solver in servers that already have one (e.g. Koibot, Kalendar etc.)~~

~~Leg's Date Solver is now stable enough for day-to-day use, with a Â±8 AP difference compared to Koibot.~~

Leg's Date Solver is now stable enough to replace other Date Solver bots, with the only issue being that Leg might be slower.
{% endhint %}

Leg has the ability to solve your dates and give you a path that finishes the date with either good AR, a ring or a mall visit.

To use it, simply press Date in your character visit menu and wait a bit. Leg will automatically appear with the Date Solver.

Alternatively, you can also do "kvi" again to move the Date Solver menu.

### Leg's Date Solver Features

* Completely free, with great pathing regardless of whether you have Premium Access.
* Highly flexible, with features such as Safe Airplaning/Unsafe Ring Routing and etc.
* Date Recovery, allowing you to find routes for dates that you already started, or dates that were being solved by other Date Solver bots.
* Fast updates, with Date Solver receiving updates soon after Karuta changes date maps (and in most cases, no update is needed at all!)
* Tight integration with [Reminders](../useful-utilities/reminders.md), allowing you to receive reminders for when your date will be available again.
