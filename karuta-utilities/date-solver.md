# Date Solver

{% hint style="info" %}
Date Solver is still in Beta. You can disable/enable it with:\
\- "[leg userconfig](../bot-management/user-feature-configuration/) date\_solver true/false" (Users)\
\- "[leg featureset](../bot-management/guild-feature-configuration/) date\_solver true/false" (Servers)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, Beta limitations include:

* ~~Incorrect graphics~~
* Missing artwork
* Slow pathfinding
* Unoptimal routing (Semi-fixed?)

These issues will hopefully be fixed in the future.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
~~It's highly recommended to disable Leg's Date Solver in servers that already have one (e.g. Koibot, Kalendar etc.)~~

Leg's Date Solver is now stable enough for day-to-day use, with a Â±8 AP difference compared to Koibot.
{% endhint %}

Leg has the ability to solve your dates and give you a path that finishes the date with either good AR, a ring or a mall visit.

To use it, simply press Date in your character visit menu and wait a bit. Leg will automatically appear with the Date Solver.

Alternatively, you can also do "kvi" again to move the Date Solver menu.
