# Daily Reward Solver

![Daily Reward Solver](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)

Daily Reward Solver gives you the answer, as well as further elaboration, about Daily Reward questions.

The solver automatically appears when you do "kdaily".

If you like to challenge yourself or find the solver too spammy, you can disable it [for yourself](../../bot-management/user-feature-configuration/list-of-user-configurable-features/daily\_solver.md) or [for a server/channel](../../bot-management/server-feature-configuration/list-of-features/daily\_solver.md).
