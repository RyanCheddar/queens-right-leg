# Daily Quiz Solver

![Daily Reward Solver](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (34) (1).png>)

Daily Quiz Solver gives you the answer, as well as further elaboration, about Daily Quiz questions.

The solver automatically appears when you do "kdaily" and enter the quiz UI.

If you like to challenge yourself or find the solver too spammy, you can disable it [for yourself](../../bot-management/user-feature-configuration/list-of-user-configurable-features/daily\_solver.md) or [for a server/channel](../../bot-management/server-feature-configuration/list-of-features/daily\_solver.md).
