# Alias List

With Alias List, you can see the list of aliases a character has that Leg is currently remembering.

This isn't guaranteed to be a full list of a character's aliases, it's only aliases that Leg has encountered before.

{% hint style="info" %}
Command: "leg aliases \[UUID]"
{% endhint %}
