# Cached Lookup

{% hint style="info" %}
Command: "leg lookup"

Aliases: "lu", "klu", "search", "find"

\
You can also reply to a Drop Analysis message to look up the dropped characters. (Does not work in Massdrop Mode)
{% endhint %}

Cached Lookup allows you to bypass Karuta and search a character directly within Leg's database.

Cached Lookup provides you roughly the same functionalities as a normal Karuta lookup, with some exceptions:

#### Missing Functionality

* Data about the quality of cards in circulation are not available.
* Accurate alias count isn't provided. Instead, Leg only counts the aliases he knows.

#### Added Functionality

* Estimated Base Value for editions is available.
* [Character UUID](../../faq-frequently-asked-questions/whats-a-character-uuid.md)s for characters are provided.
* A shortcut to Leg's [Card Finder](card-finder.md) is provided.
* Cached Dojo stats for characters are provided.
* The minimum amount of time someone has been a character's koibito is displayed.
* The genders of characters are provided.
