# Update Dye Data

{% hint style="info" %}
Command: "leg dyeupdate"\
Aliases: "updatedyes", "updatedye"

You may need to do "kdyes" first before running this command.
{% endhint %}

For privacy reasons (and to respect Karuta privacy settings), Leg **will never** obtain your dye data without your consent. Even if you have provided authorization, you still need to run dyeupdate manually to keep Leg's dye database up-to-date.

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, any dyes you import into Leg will be accessible to everyone in dye utilities.\
\
You can make your dyes private with `leg userconfig dye_public false`.
{% endhint %}
