# Clan Viewer

{% hint style="info" %}
Command: "leg clanviewer"

Aliases: "clansviewer", "clanview", "clanlist"\
\
Clan Viewer requires you to [reply](https://app.gitbook.com/s/0OfyDder0TDbYepM9qYh/\~/changes/fKx6pW5EYhSbbpq0LIXz/faq-frequently-asked-questions/how-do-i-use-reply-based-commands) to a "View Clan" message (kcv) in order for it to work.

\
To make it easier to access Clan Viewer, you can also reply to a "View Clan" message with [Collection Viewer](../card-collection-utilities/collection-viewer.md)'s commands (e.g. `leg cv`) and it'd still summon Clan Viewer.
