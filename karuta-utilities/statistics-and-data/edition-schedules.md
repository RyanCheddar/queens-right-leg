# Edition Schedules

Leg is able to show you what cards are dropping now/in the future with its extensive database.

{% hint style="info" %}
Command: "edschedule"

Aliases: "dropschedule", "schedules", "schedule"
{% endhint %}

The data shown here are collected from Karuta look up menus. If a new edition is added by Karuta, all characters in the release schedule will be added (e.g. Leg currently knows the dropping time for all Edition 4 cards from the initial wave).&#x20;
