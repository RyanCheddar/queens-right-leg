# Edition Schedules

Leg is able to show you what cards are dropping now/in the future with its extensive database.

{% hint style="info" %}
Command: "edschedule"

Aliases: "dropschedule", "schedules", "schedule"

The data shown here are collected from Karuta look up menus.

If Karuta adds a new edition to the game and publishes a release schedule, all cards from the release schedule will be viewable in this command as well.
