# Best Base Value Finder

Leg is able to utilize its ability to calculate base values of character editions to show you what cards may have the highest base values.

{% hint style="info" %}
Command: "leg bestbv"

Aliases: "besteffort", "besteff"
{% endhint %}

Leg's base value calculation may not be 100% accurate, and some characters' edition data may be too outdated for their estimated base value to be representative of their actual effort.

The finder will automatically update with the most up-to-date information when you or someone looks up any of the character editions.
