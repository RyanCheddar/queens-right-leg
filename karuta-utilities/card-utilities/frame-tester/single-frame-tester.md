# Single Frame Tester

Single Frame Tester allows you to see how a specific frame looks on a character.

{% hint style="info" %}
Command: "leg frametester [\[Character UUID\]](../../../faq-frequently-asked-questions/whats-a-character-uuid.md) \[Frame Name]"

Alias: "frametest"

\
You can skip typing in a Character UUID by [reply](../../../faq-frequently-asked-questions/how-do-i-use-reply-based-commands.md)ing to a character's lookup page, in either Karuta or Leg.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Some frames might look broken, ugly or have incorrect text colors. This is because these frames have not been optimized for frame testing use.



You can check whether a frame is optimized by looking at the Print and Card code spots. If the text "Queen's" and "Right Leg" are there, it's an optimized frame.



If not, it's auto-generated and will likely have discrepancies with how the frame looks in Karuta.
