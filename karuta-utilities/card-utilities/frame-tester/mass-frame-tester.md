# Mass Frame Tester

Mass Frame Tester allows you to see how a bunch of frames look on a specific character.

{% hint style="info" %}
Command: "leg massframetester [\[Character UUID\]](../../../faq-frequently-asked-questions/whats-a-character-uuid.md) \[Frame Name]"

Aliases: "massframetest", "bulkframetester", "bulkframetest", "multiframetester", "multiframetest"\


You can skip typing in a Character UUID by [reply](../../../faq-frequently-asked-questions/how-do-i-use-reply-based-commands.md)ing to a character's lookup page, in either Karuta or Leg.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Mass Frame Tester might take a while to generate. Unless it throws an error, it's likely still working.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Some frames might look broken, ugly or have incorrect text colors. This is because these frames have not been optimized for frame testing use. ​

\
You can check whether a frame is optimized by looking at the Print and Card code spots. If the text "Queen's" and "Right Leg" are there, it's an optimized frame. ​ \
\
If not, it's auto-generated and will likely have discrepancies with how the frame looks in Karuta.
