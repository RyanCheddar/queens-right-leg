{% hint style="info" %}
Some frames might look broken, ugly or have incorrect text colors. This is because these frames have not been optimized for frame testing use.



You can check whether a frame is optimized by looking at the Print and Card code spots. If the text "Queen's" and "Right Leg" are there, it's an optimized frame.&#x20;



If not, it's auto-generated.
