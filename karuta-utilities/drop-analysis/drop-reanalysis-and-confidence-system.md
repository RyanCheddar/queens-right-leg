# Drop Reanalysis and Confidence System

If you/your server has [Premium Access](../../boring-stuff/premium-access/), you may notice that drops sometimes show "Reanalysing Drop", or characters might sometimes have percentages next to them.

This is actually Leg's Confidence system in play, which helps Leg identify most (if not all) characters that he missed during initial analysis.

The percentage represents how confident Leg is in its guess for the character during reanalysis. This percentage doesn't exist for characters from initial analysis, because Leg is always 100% confident for those characters.

Drop Reanalysis is a very powerful ability of Leg that allows other features like [Wishlist Count Notifications](../../admin-management/drop-notifications/wishlist-count-notifications.md) and [Dropboards](../../admin-management/dropboards.md) to function better, but is unfortunately currently restricted to Premium only as it is very resource intensive.
