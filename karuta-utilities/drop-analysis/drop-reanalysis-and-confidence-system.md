# Confidence System

Sometimes, you may notice that characters in drop analysis messages have percentages next to them.

This is actually Leg's Confidence system in play, which helps Leg with always correctly identifying characters.

The percentage represents how confident Leg is in its guess for the character during analysis. This percentage doesn't exist for most cards, because Leg is 100% confident for those characters.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Confidence System was previously exclusive to Premium Access in a second stage of analysis called Drop Reanalysis, but Drop Reanalysis has since been removed, with the Confidence System becoming available for all drops, regardless of Premium Access.
