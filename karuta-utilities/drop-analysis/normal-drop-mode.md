# Normal Drop Mode

Normal Drop Mode:

* Lets you see the full result of Leg's analysis
* Tells you when a card has a good print number
* Shows when a drop will expire/has expired
* Allows you to look up the cards in a drop all at once by replying with [Cached Lookup](https://github.com/RyanCheddar/queens-right-leg/blob/5bef42a434d17e00a42f1d9bf20ed34a89518d48/karuta-utilities/character-tools/cached-lookup.md)

However, Normal Drop Mode also comes with certain drawbacks:

* Normal Drop Mode is slower than Massdrop Mode due to the extra processing involved
* Might create spam when a channel has a lot of drop traffic
* Creates clutter in the chat
