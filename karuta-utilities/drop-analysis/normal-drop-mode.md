# Normal Drop Mode

![Example of Drop Analysis in Normal Mode](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)

Normal Drop Mode:

* Lets you see the full result of Leg's analysis
* Tells you when a card **possibly** has a good print number
* Attempts to guess a cards wishlist number when the analysis potentially got the card's name/series wrong
* Reanalyses the drop for better results when there's potential incorrect data in the analysis \[Premium Only]

However, Normal Drop Mode also comes with certain drawbacks:

* Normal Drop Mode is slower than Massdrop Mode due to the extra processing involved
* Might create spam when a channel has a lot of drop traffic
* Creates clutter in the chat
