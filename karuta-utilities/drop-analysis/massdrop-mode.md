# Massdrop Mode

In comparison to Normal Drop Mode, Massdrop Mode is way faster, stays silent when a card drop isn't special and stays out of players' way.

![Massdrop Mode sending a message to notify about a high wishlist card (Yae Miko)
If the drop had no high wishlist characters, Leg stays silent.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png>)

Massdrop Mode:

* Only sends a message when a card drop contains a high wishlist character
* Analyses card drops way faster

However, Massdrop Mode:

* Does not check for good print numbers on cards
* Does not tell you about cards that have wishlist counts lower than 50

{% hint style="info" %}
Massdrop Mode can be enabled using the "massdrop" command in a channel.
{% endhint %}
