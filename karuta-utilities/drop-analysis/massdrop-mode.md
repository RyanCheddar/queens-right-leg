# Massdrop Mode

In comparison to Normal Drop Mode, Massdrop Mode is way faster, stays silent when a card drop isn't special and stays out of players' way.

Massdrop Mode:

* Only sends a message when a card drop contains a high wishlist character
* Analyses card drops way faster

However, Massdrop Mode:

* Does not check for good print numbers on cards
* Does not tell you about cards that have wishlist counts lower than 50
