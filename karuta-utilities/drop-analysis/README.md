# Drop Analysis

Leg has the ability to analyse drops automatically as they happen.

To do so, he reads drop messages from Karuta to find card information, then compares the data to Leg's own card database, and returns a list of the card drops, along with their last known wishlist numbers.

Drop Analysis is enabled by default. To disable it, use the "featureset" command ([Feature Configuration](https://github.com/RyanCheddar/queens-right-leg/blob/5bef42a434d17e00a42f1d9bf20ed34a89518d48/bot-management/server-feature-configuration))
