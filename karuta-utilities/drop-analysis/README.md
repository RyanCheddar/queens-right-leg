# Drop Analysis

Leg has the ability to analyse drops automatically as they happen.&#x20;

To do so, he reads drop messages from Karuta to find card information, then compares the data to Leg's own card database, and returns a list of the card drops, along with their last known wishlist numbers.

{% hint style="info" %}
Drop Analysis is enabled by default. To disable it, use the "featureset" command ([Feature Configuration](../../bot-management/guild-feature-configuration/))
{% endhint %}
