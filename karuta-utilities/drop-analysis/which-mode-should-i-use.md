# Which mode should I use?

Normal Drop Mode is perfect for channels where:

* Drop traffic is sparse
* Access is limited to certain people (Such as Nitro Boosters or Donors)

In comparison, Massdrop Mode is better for channels where:

* There's very high drop traffic
* There's many people interacting with Karuta
* Massdrops / Drop Parties happen

{% hint style="warning" %}
Leg might automatically enable Massdrop Mode when a channel has too much drop traffic. You can disable Massdrop Mode with "leg massdrop" once the channel's traffic has calmed down. \
\
A channel might get locked into Massdrop Mode or frequently switch back to Massdrop Mode if drop traffic stays high. \
\
You can increase the drop quota for channels by purchasing Server Premium (From 14 drops/3mins/channel > 30 drops/3mins/channel)
