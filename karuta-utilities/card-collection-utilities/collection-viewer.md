# Collection Viewer

Collection Viewer gives you a more in-depth view of your card collection than Karuta offers. Offering a myriad of features such as estimated pricing, card code notes, wishlist numbers (even when you're not sorting by wishlist), a tile view and more!

Collection Viewer requires you to [reply](https://app.gitbook.com/s/0OfyDder0TDbYepM9qYh/\~/changes/fKx6pW5EYhSbbpq0LIXz/faq-frequently-asked-questions/how-do-i-use-reply-based-commands) to a "Card Collection" message (kc) in order for it to work.
